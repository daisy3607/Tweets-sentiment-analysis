# Tweets sentiment analysis

Nowadays, users post their daily thoughts, feelings or feedbacks after visiting a place on social media, such as Twitter or Facebook.

If we could recognize users' sentiments of posts in a short time, it'll be easier for service provider to take users' feedbacks and improve their service.

The project aims to recognize sentiments in more than 40,000 tweets with LSTM models.


## Experiment

* pretraining word embedding with gensim
* train LSTM models


## File description
  * `rnn_train.py` trains LSTM models.
  * `eval.py` for inference
